data(mtcars)
mtcars$cyl <- factor(mtcars$cyl, levels = c("4","6","8"),
                     labels = c("four","six","eight"))
tbl <- ftable(mtcars$cyl, mtcars$vs, mtcars$am, mtcars$gear,
              row.vars = c(2, 4),
              dnn = c("Cylinders", "V/S", "Transmission", "Gears"))

kable(tbl,booktabs=TRUE)
# plot(mtcars)
