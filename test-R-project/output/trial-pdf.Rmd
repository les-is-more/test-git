## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, fig.align='center', fig.pos="b",fig.height=3, fig.width=5,echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Pressure caption"}
plot(pressure)
```


```{r table#1, format='latex', echo=FALSE}
data(mtcars)
mtcars$cyl <- factor(mtcars$cyl, levels = c("4","6","8"),
                     labels = c("four","six","eight"))
tbl <- ftable(mtcars$cyl, mtcars$vs, mtcars$am, mtcars$gear,
              row.vars = c(2, 4),
              dnn = c("Cylinders", "V/S", "Transmission", "Gears"))
kable(tbl,format='latex',booktabs=T)

```
